## Setting Up Your Web Development Environment - Instruction Manual

This quick instruction manual will guide you through setting up your web development environment by installing popular tools like Visual Studio Code, iTerm (for macOS), Git, and Homebrew.

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a highly popular and versatile code editor that supports a wide range of programming languages and extensions.

1. Visit the official Visual Studio Code website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Follow the installation instructions for your OS and complete the installation.

### Step 2: Install iTerm (for macOS)

iTerm is a powerful and feature-rich terminal emulator for macOS. If you are using a different operating system, you can skip this step.

1. Visit the official iTerm website: [https://iterm2.com/](https://iterm2.com/)
2. Download the latest stable release.
3. Once the download is complete, open the .dmg file and drag the iTerm application into your "Applications" folder.

### Step 3: Install Homebrew (for macOS and Linux)

Homebrew is a package manager that simplifies the installation of software on macOS and Linux.

#### For macOS:

1. Open the Terminal (or iTerm).
2. Install Homebrew by running the following command:
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

#### For Linux:

1. Open the Terminal.
2. Install Homebrew by running the following command:
   ```
   sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Linuxbrew/install/master/install.sh)"
   ```

### Step 4: Install Git

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code and collaborate with other developers.

#### For macOS:

1. If you have installed Homebrew (Step 4), you can simply open the Terminal (or iTerm) and run the following command:
   ```
   brew install git
   ```

#### For Windows:

1. Visit the official Git website: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Download the Git installer for Windows.
3. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard's instructions.

#### For Linux:

1. Use your package manager to install Git. For example, on Ubuntu, open the Terminal and run:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install git
   ```

### Step 5: Verify Installations

To ensure everything was installed correctly, verify the installations of Visual Studio Code, Git, and Homebrew:

#### Visual Studio Code:

Open Visual Studio Code by searching for it in your applications or running the appropriate command.

#### Git:

Open the Terminal (or iTerm) and run the following command to check the installed Git version:
```
git --version
```

#### Homebrew:

If you installed Homebrew, run the following command to verify the installation:
```
brew --version
```

Congratulations! You have set up your web development environment with essential tools like Visual Studio Code, iTerm (if applicable), Git, and Homebrew. You're now ready to start coding and building amazing web applications! Happy coding!
